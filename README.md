<h3>Learn to Code Python For a Device</h3>
Hej!<br>
We have put together a few kits of a tiny microcontroller, a small LED matrix and a joystick.<br>
There is also a <a href="https://github.com/IKEAmaker/LearnPython4Devices/raw/master/Docs/LearnToCode-CompleteGuide.pdf">step by step guide</a> that should get you started with coding.<br>
The target audience for this kit is 100% analog humans with zero coding experience.<br>
We hope this is a fun way to get into digital creativity<br>

One of the projects in the guide includes a scrolling text display:<br>
