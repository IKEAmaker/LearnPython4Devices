#Learn to Code Python For a Device
Hej!

We have put together a few kits of a tiny microcontroller, a small LED matrix and a joystick.
There is also a [step by step guide](https://github.com/IKEAmaker/LearnPython4Devices/raw/master/Docs/LearnToCode-CompleteGuide.pdf)> that should get you started with coding.
The target audience for this kit is 100% analog humans with zero coding experience.
We hope this is a fun way to get into digital creativity.
One of the projects in the guide includes a scrolling text display:

#Build This kit
If you can come to Maker Friday at the Co-Create lab and we'll help you out.
There is a quick instruction on soldering you can check out in this video:
